\title{Download one or more AquaMatch harmonized data products from EDI}
\usage{
download_parameters(parameters, version = "newest")
}
\arguments{
\item{parameters}{A character vector containing one or more strings of AquaMatch
parameters to download (written as abbreviations). Options are currently
"chla" for chlorophyll \emph{a}, "doc" for dissolved organic carbon, "sdd" for
Secchi disk depth, and "tss" for total suspended solids.}

\item{version}{Either "newest" or an integer corresponding to the data package
version to use. Note that in its current form, this function uses a single
value for every parameter requested. So, if \code{c("chla", "doc", "sdd")} is provided
to \code{parameters} and a \code{2} is provided to \code{version}, the second version of each
dataset will be requested, whether or not it actually exists.}
}
\value{
A named list where each item is a tibble containing a dataset.
}
\description{
A function to facilitate downloading AquaMatch harmonized data products from
the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI). It accepts one or more shortened
parameter names, downloads the corresponding dataset(s) from EDI, and
returns them to the user as list items.
}
\note{
Returned datasets will be large (hundreds of MB in size), so users with limited
computer memory may wish to run a separate function call for each dataset
they want to download. These datasets will also be loaded into memory, meaning
that they are not currently saved permanently to the user's computer. We
suggest using \code{readr::write_csv()} or \code{feather::write_feather()} to save
permanent local copies.

\examples{
# Downloads the most recent version of the Secchi disk depth dataset
sdd_test <- download_parameters(parameters = "sdd")
# This is a list with a single item
length(sdd_test)
# Extract data frame from the list:
sdd <- sdd_test$sdd
}
